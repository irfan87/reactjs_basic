# reactjs_basic

To use this tutorial, don't forget to install the packages from `package.json` by using `npm install` or `npm i`.

Run `npm start` and forward `localhost:8080` to your favorite browser. 

Checked your browser to see either the webpack is successfully launch or not.

If the webpack is not working, please don't hesitate to contact me via github. :raised_hands: :email:
