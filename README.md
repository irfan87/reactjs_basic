# reactjs_basic

To use this tutorial, don't forget to install by using `npm install` or `npm i` the packages from package.json.

Then run `npm start` and forward `localhost:8080` to the browser. 

Then checked the browser to see either the webpack is successfully launched or not.

If it not working, please don't hesitate to contact me via github. :raised_hands: :email:
